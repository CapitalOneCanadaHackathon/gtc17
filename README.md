# GiftTheCode

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to root directory in your favourite terminal
3. Run `yarn install` (or `npm install` I guess, but that doesn't have lockfiles)
4. Umm... Past that do what you want I guess, just don't screw too much up. :D

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploying on Firebase

From the root directory, run `npm run firebase-deploy`. This will build the project, generate a service worker, and then deploy it to firebase.
